# Azure Multivariate Anomaly Detector Lab
## Introduction
Anomaly Detector with Multivariate Anomaly Detection (MVAD) is an advanced AI tool for detecting anomalies from a group of metrics in an unsupervised manner. In this lab, we will train a multivariate anomaly detection model with a benchmark dataset **SKAB**, and make inference with both synchronous and asynchronous api.
